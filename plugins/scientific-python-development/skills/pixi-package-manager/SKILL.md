### Quick Decision Tree: Pixi vs UV vs Both

```
Need compiled scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, GDAL)?
├─ YES → Use pixi (conda-forge has pre-built binaries)
└─ NO → Consider uv for pure Python projects

Need multi-language support (Python + R, Julia, C++)?
├─ YES → Use pixi (supports conda ecosystem)
└─ NO → uv sufficient for Python-only

Need multiple environments (dev, test, prod, GPU, CPU)?
├─ YES → Use pixi features for environment management
└─ NO → Single environment projects work with either

Need reproducible environments across platforms?
├─ CRITICAL → Use pixi (lockfiles include all platforms)
└─ LESS CRITICAL → uv also provides lockfiles

Want to use both conda-forge AND PyPI packages?
├─ YES → Use pixi (seamless integration)
└─ ONLY PYPI → uv is simpler and faster

Legacy conda environment files (environment.yml)?
├─ YES → pixi can import and modernize
└─ NO → Start fresh with pixi or uv
```

## When to Use This Skill

- **Setting up scientific Python projects** with complex compiled dependencies (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, GDAL, netCDF4)
- **Building reproducible research environments** that work identically across different machines and platforms
- **Managing multi-language projects** that combine Python with R, Julia, C++, or Fortran
- **Creating multiple environment configurations** for different hardware (GPU/CPU), testing scenarios, or deployment targets
- **Replacing conda/mamba workflows** with faster, more reliable dependency resolution
- **Developing packages that depend on both conda-forge and PyPI** packages
- **Migrating from environment.yml or requirements.txt** to modern, reproducible workflows
- **Running automated scientific workflows** with task runners and CI/CD integration
- **Working with geospatial, climate, or astronomy packages** that require complex C/Fortran dependencies

## Core Concepts

### 1. Unified Package Management (conda + PyPI)

Pixi resolves dependencies from **both conda-forge and PyPI** in a single unified graph, ensuring compatibility:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-science-project"
dependencies = [
    "numpy>=1.24",      # from conda-forge (optimized builds)
    "pandas>=2.0",      # from conda-forge
]

[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
my-custom-pkg = ">=1.0"        # PyPI-only package
```

**Why this matters for scientific Python:**
- Get optimized NumPy/SciPy builds from conda-forge (MKL, OpenBLAS)
- Use PyPI packages not available in conda
- Single lockfile ensures all dependencies are compatible

### 2. Multi-Platform Lockfiles

Pixi generates `pixi.lock` with dependency specifications for **all platforms** (Linux, macOS, Windows, different architectures):

```toml
# pixi.lock includes:
# - linux-64
# - osx-64, osx-arm64
# - win-64
```

**Benefits:**
- Commit lockfile to git → everyone gets identical environments
- Works on collaborator's different OS without changes
- CI/CD uses exact same versions as local development

### 3. Feature-Based Environments

Create multiple environments using **features** without duplicating dependencies:

```toml
[tool.pixi.feature.test.dependencies]
pytest = ">=7.0"
pytest-cov = ">=4.0"

[tool.pixi.feature.gpu.dependencies]
pytorch-cuda = "11.8.*"

[tool.pixi.environments]
test = ["test"]
gpu = ["gpu"]
gpu-test = ["gpu", "test"]  # combines features
```

### 4. Task Automation

Define reusable commands as tasks:

```toml
[tool.pixi.tasks]
test = "pytest tests/ -v"
format = "ruff format src/ tests/"
lint = "ruff check src/ tests/"
docs = "sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build"
analyse = { cmd = "python scripts/analyze.py", depends-on = ["test"] }
```

### 5. Fast Dependency Resolution

Pixi uses **rattler** (Rust-based conda resolver) for 10-100x faster resolution than conda:

- Parallel package downloads
- Efficient caching
- Smart dependency solver

### 6. pyproject.toml Integration

Pixi reads standard Python project metadata from `pyproject.toml`, enabling:
- Single source of truth for project configuration
- Compatibility with pip, uv, and other tools
- Standard Python packaging workflows

## Quick Start

### Minimal Example: Data Analysis Project

```bash
# Create new project
mkdir climate-analysis && cd climate-analysis
pixi init --format pyproject

# Add scientific stack
pixi add python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib xarray

# Add development tools
pixi add --feature dev pytest ipython ruff

# Create analysis script
cat > analyze.py << 'EOF'
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Your analysis code
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.plot()
plt.savefig("output.png")
EOF

# Run in pixi environment
pixi run python analyze.py

# Or activate shell
pixi shell
python analyze.py
```

## Best Practices Checklist

### Project Setup
- [ ] Use `pixi init --format pyproject` for new projects
- [ ] Set explicit Python version constraint (`python>=3.11,<3.13`)
- [ ] Organize dependencies by source (conda vs PyPI)
- [ ] Create separate features for dev, test, docs environments
- [ ] Define useful tasks for common workflows
- [ ] Set up `.gitignore` to exclude `.pixi/` directory

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Prefer conda-forge for compiled scientific packages (NumPy, SciPy, GDAL)
- [ ] Use PyPI only for pure Python or conda-unavailable packages
- [ ] Pin exact versions for reproducible research
- [ ] Use version ranges for libraries (allow updates)
- [ ] Specify solve groups for independent environment solving
- [ ] Use `pixi update` regularly to get security patches

### Reproducibility
- [ ] Commit `pixi.lock` to version control
- [ ] Include all platforms in lockfile for cross-platform teams
- [ ] Document environment recreation steps in README
- [ ] Use exact version pins for published research
- [ ] Test environment from scratch periodically
- [ ] Archive environments for long-term preservation

### Performance
- [ ] Use pixi's parallel downloads (automatic)
- [ ] Leverage caching in CI/CD (`prefix-dev/setup-pixi` action)
- [ ] Keep environments minimal (only necessary dependencies)
- [ ] Use solve groups to isolate independent environments
- [ ] Clean old packages with `pixi clean cache`

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Define tasks for common operations (test, lint, format)
- [ ] Use task dependencies for complex workflows
- [ ] Create environment-specific tasks when needed
- [ ] Use `pixi shell` for interactive development
- [ ] Use `pixi run` for automated scripts and CI
