# Python Development Agents

Agents specialized in scientific Python development, modern packaging, and reproducible research workflows.

## Overview

This category contains agents focused on Python-specific development practices for scientific computing, including:

- Modern Python packaging and project structure
- Reproducible environment management
- Testing and quality assurance for scientific code
- Documentation and publication workflows
- Performance optimization for numerical code

## Available Skills

- **[pixi-package-manager](skills/pixi-package-manager/SKILL.md)**: Fast, reproducible scientific Python environments with pixi - conda and PyPI unified
- **[python-packaging](skills/python-packaging/SKILL.md)**: Modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml, src layout, and Hatchling build backend
- **[python-testing](skills/python-testing/SKILL.md)**: Writing robust tests with pytest following Scientific Python best practices

## Available Agents

- **[scientific-python-expert](agents/scientific-python-expert.md)**: Expert in building reproducible scientific software using the modern Python ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.)

## When to Use These Agents

Use Python development agents when you need help with:

- Setting up new scientific Python projects
- Implementing modern packaging with pyproject.toml
- Managing dependencies and environments for reproducibility
- Writing tests for numerical and scientific code
- Creating documentation for research software
- Optimizing Python code for scientific computing
